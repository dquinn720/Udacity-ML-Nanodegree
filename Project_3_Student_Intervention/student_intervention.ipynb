In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

While we could view this problem as a spectrum, 0 being not intervention and 1 being intervention, and hence a regression problem, it makes less sense as there isn't a clear action if the model predicts a value of 0.5.  Therefore, I will interpret this as a classification problem."

    "**Answer: ** The three models I am going to run are: SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Ensemble Method with AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVM**\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example of using SVM is trying to classify stocks into winners and losers based on characteristics of the stock. (http://content.iospress.com/download/algorithmic-finance/af016?id=algorithmic-finance%2Faf016). You can take the 10% best and worst performing stocks over a certain time period and then run an SVM classifier to build the parameters. Then you could test this model in an out of sample data set and invest accordingly.\n",
    "A strength of SVM is that they work well in complicated domains when there is a clear separator in the classification. Therefore, they perform well on data sets that aren't very noisy.\n",
    "A weakness of SVM's is that the training time increases rapidly as it can be squared or cubic. Therefore, SVM's are slow and don't work well when the data set is quite large with lots of features.\n",
    "Given that the dataset we are looking at is not very complicated, there aren't too many data points, an SVM should work well. Also, it is imaginable that there will be a clear separation between the classes given that passing and failing should not be very noisy. Doing a lot of homework and failing would be quite rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes **\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example of using Gaussian Naive Bayes is taking fMRI images and trying to determine if the patient was looking at one image type or the other, for example a hammer or a building (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_sp09/lectures/NBayes2_2-2-2009-ann.pdf). As the feature variable is continuous, location of activity on a scan, the Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation normalizes the feature data to compute the classification.\n",
    "The strength of Gaussian Naive Bayes is that the time to implement is quite low and multiple features can be handled easily. It will perform well when you don't have much data as it does not require much training data to estimate the classification parameters.\n",
    "A weakness of Gaussian Naive Bayes is that the model assumes complete independance amongst the feautures. Therefore, the model will not perform well when the features are correlated, such as the housing data. The size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms in a house are likely correlated.\n",
    "I think this model could be a good candidate as there are not a lot of training points, and yet many features. The Gaussian Naive Bayes will be able to handle this well. My concern is the independance assumption as there could be a correlation between absences, studytime and internt potentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods with AdaBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example of AdaBoost is detecting faces by investigating the pixels that have the strongest prediction (https://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/EE148-2005-Spring/pprs/viola04ijcv.pdf).\n",
    "The strength of AdaBoost, and Boosting in general, is that it will find the features that do the best in classifying and ignore features that are just noise. Therefore, boosting will work well when there are features that strongly correlate to the different classes.\n",
    "A weakness of AdaBoost is that it tries very hard to classify correctly. If a data point is mis-labelled for instance, the model will try to label it correctly and impair the out of sample testing. Therefore, boosting does not work particularly well with noisy, mislabelled data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)#Criticism).\n",
    "I think boosting will do a good job with our data because there are some strong features that should predict passing or failing, such as study time, activities and absences. Also, the data should be correctly labelled so I don't have concerns with too noisy of data."

The Support Vector Machine was the most reliable in our testing of working out of sample. Out of sample testing gives us the reassurance that we didn't build a model that only works with certain data. While some other models performed well out of sample, their performance was more variable, suggesting some potential overfitting.\n",

    "By printing out the best estimator, I can see that the linear model was chosen with a C value of 0.05 and a gamma value of 0.0001. However, since gamma is not used in a linear model, only when we do the kernel trick, this parameter is irrelevent. Therefore, a linear model with a relatively low C value did best on the test set. The low value of C means that there is a softer margin during training, meaning that misclassifying a few points is ok if the margin is a bit wider."
